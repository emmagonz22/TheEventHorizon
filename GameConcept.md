Game Title: Event Horizon
Concept:

In "Event Horizon," you control a black hole that influences the environment around a space explorer's ship. The explorer is on a mission to gather valuable cosmic artifacts scattered across various space sectors. However, the explorer's ship moves automatically, and your role is to manipulate the gravitational pull of the black hole to guide the ship safely through dangerous space environments.
Core Mechanics:

    Black Hole Control: You can move the black hole around the screen, altering its gravitational pull. The black hole can attract or repel objects in space, creating safe paths or removing obstacles from the explorer's way.

    Environmental Hazards: Space is filled with asteroids, debris, and other celestial bodies. You must use the black hole's gravity to either pull hazards out of the explorer's path or push them into safe areas.

    Gravity Manipulation: The black hole’s gravity can be intensified or weakened to control the speed and direction of objects in space. This can help the explorer avoid collisions or slow down to collect artifacts.

    Timed Challenges: Some levels might have collapsing stars, supernovas, or other cosmic events that require quick and precise use of the black hole’s gravity to guide the explorer through before time runs out.

Aesthetic:

The game would have a minimalist, sci-fi pixel art style, with deep space backgrounds, glowing stars, and the black hole represented by a swirling vortex with a gravitational pull effect. The music would be atmospheric, with a focus on the vast, mysterious nature of space.
Unique Selling Point:

"Event Horizon" offers a unique twist on the puzzle genre by letting players control the powerful forces of a black hole to manipulate the environment. The challenge lies in managing the delicate balance of gravitational forces to keep the explorer safe while guiding them to their goal.

This concept combines the intriguing mechanics of gravitational manipulation with the mystery and awe of space, providing a fresh and engaging gameplay experience.
